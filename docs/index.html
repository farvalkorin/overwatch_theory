    <h1>Overwatch Theory</h1>
    
    <p>How do two heros compare when they're facing off?</p>

    <p>The package is in the process of a fork/rewrite. Pull Requests welcome to implement new heros.</p>

    <h2>McCree</h2>
    
    <p>McCree is a great hero to start. He has a stun mechanic, single shot damage and no default armor.</p>
